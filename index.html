  <h3><a href="https://apawl.com/talks/esip_s19.html">Security and Compliance in the Government Cloud</a> ESIP Summer Meeting. July 16, 2019.</h3>

  <p>This talk discusses the mapping of existing cybersecurity controls (namely, NIST 800-53) to the cloud. Its core thesis is that the complexity and pace of iteration in the cloud necessitates a more adaptive security model. It discusses some capabilities that should be developed, and helpful services in those contexts.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://apawl.com/talks/pangeo-lp-ornl.html">An Introduction to Pangeo.</a> NASA Land Processing and Oak Ridge National Laboratory DAACs User Working Group 2019. June 3rd, 2019.</h3>

  <p>This talk provides an overview on the Pangeo project and community. It discussed what Pangeo is, what its motivations are, how to deploy its stack, and how to contribute back to the community. I tried to contextualize it along a question asked by a USGS staff scientist (Aaron Friesz) regarding practical use, so focused on the details of three core packages: xarray, dask, and jupyter. Please note that many of these slides were sourced from other Pangeo talks; I attribute them to their authors on the slides themselves.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://apawl.com/talks/satcat.html">Cloud-Native Archives of Convenience for Remote Sensing Workloads.</a> ESIP Cloud Computing Cluser. May 6th, 2019.</h3>

  <p>This talk discussed the arbitrary transformation and reprojection of remote sensing data -- up to and including entire product corpuses -- based on context-specific needs. The thesis was that instead of worrying about gold data formats (e.g. netCDF, HDF, etc), we should develop transformation graphs which can produce ephemeral "archives of convenience" for given use-cases. The talk also included a demo of SatCat, a proof of concept of this idea using GOES-16 full disk ABI data.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dQfWTqbgta9D-xG3rA5zrm7A7fa0okcZRSQyiCCDiso/edit?usp=sharing">Building CubeSat Data Pipelines with Open Source Software at Element 84.</a> FOSS4G North America 2019. April 16th, 2019. (Google Slides)</h3>

  <p>This talk surveyed the open source geospatial software ecosystem in the context of small satellite lifecycles, specifically in the context of a SaaS offering. The thesis was that, with the rapidly decreasing barrier to entry for satellite launches, universities, NGOs, and other small satellite operators would be better suited to use SaaS providers for their data lifecycles rather than investing in in-house development/operational costs. The talk includes a discussion of tools we've built and contributed to at NASA (as well as those developed by others) around data product generation, data discovery, and data visualization.</p>
